## ðŸ“‹ Contribution Workflow

1. Each member works inside the **relevant feature folder**.
2. Tasks are submitted inside weekly folders using this format:  
   `weekXX/yourname_taskname`  
   Example: `week01/taha_wakeword`, `week02/zara_mood-detection`
3. Use **feature branches** (e.g., `voice-week01-basit`) to push your work.
4. Create a **Pull Request** for review before merging.
5. You may also complete someone elseâ€™s task separately â€” the **Team Lead** will decide which version to accept based on quality.
