## ðŸ“‹ Contribution Workflow

1. Each member works within their assigned module folder.
2. Create a feature branch (e.g., `cv-face-azain`, `nlp-intent-zara`).
3. Push your code and open a **Pull Request** for review.
4. All code must be aligned with the assigned task checklist.
5. You may also implement someone else's task separately â€” the **Team Lead** will review and choose the best version.

## ðŸ§  Task Management

- Tasks are assigned **every Monday**.
- All submissions are due by **Sunday**.
- Weekly **online meetings** are held to evaluate progress.
